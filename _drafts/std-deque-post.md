Most of the C++ programmers are quite familiar with the "common" STL containers. We have list, vector, array,map, set, stack, queue. Some having different underlying implementation such as std::map vs std::unordered_map with one being implemented as Red-Black tree with intrinsic key ordering while other as hash-map. Quite common interview question as well.
