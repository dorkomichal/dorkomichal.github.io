# Hi, I'm Michal Dorko

I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for high-performance computing and machine learning. Based in the United Kingdom, I specialize in C++ development and enjoy exploring the latest trends in AI and data science.

## My Journey

My journey in software engineering began with a fascination for how computers work at the lowest level. This led me to develop a deep appreciation for C++ and its ability to provide both high-level abstractions and low-level control. Over the years, I've expanded my expertise to include machine learning, where I find the intersection of mathematics, statistics, and programming particularly exciting.

## Technical Expertise

- **Languages**: C++, Python, JavaScript, SQL
- **Frameworks & Tools**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, Docker, Git
- **Areas of Interest**: Machine Learning, Computer Vision, High-Performance Computing, Software Architecture
- **Development Practices**: Test-Driven Development, Agile Methodologies, Code Review

## What I Do

When I'm not coding, you can find me:
- Reading about the latest developments in AI and machine learning
- Contributing to open source projects
- Exploring new programming languages and frameworks
- Writing technical articles and sharing knowledge with the community

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in discussing technology, software engineering challenges, or potential collaborations. Feel free to reach out through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dorkomichal/) or check out my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/dorkomichal).
