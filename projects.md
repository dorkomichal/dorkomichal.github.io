# My Projects

Here are some of the key projects and achievements that represent my technical journey and expertise.

## Featured Work

### Bytecode Compiler & Virtual Machine Development
**Technologies**: C++, Assembly, Compiler Design, Virtual Machine Architecture  
**Description**: Led the development of SlangVM, a modern bytecode runtime for Goldman Sachs's proprietary programming language Slang. This project significantly improved runtime efficiency and reduced energy consumption.

**Key Achievements**:
- Designed and implemented a modern bytecode virtual machine
- Achieved significant performance improvements over the existing tree-walker interpreter
- Reduced computing power requirements and energy consumption
- Presented findings at [QCon London 2023](https://qconlondon.com/presentation/mar2023/runtime-efficiency-carbon-efficiency) on "From Runtime Efficiency to Carbon Efficiency"
- Contributed to green software initiatives and sustainability in software engineering

**Impact**: The new VM runs inherently faster on modern CPUs with specific optimization techniques such as constant pools, making it more energy efficient and carbon efficient.

### Astronomical Data Analysis with Machine Learning
**Technologies**: Python, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  
**Description**: Master's dissertation project at Cambridge University focusing on categorizing Milky Way stellar populations using Gaussian Mixture Models.

**Key Features**:
- Applied Gaussian Mixture Models to analyze stellar chemical and dynamical properties
- Developed machine learning pipeline for astronomical data classification
- Statistical analysis of stellar population characteristics
- Data visualization and interpretation of results

**Academic Impact**: Contributed to understanding of stellar populations in our galaxy through machine learning approaches.

## Future Projects

### Technical Blog
I would love to start writing technical blog posts if time permits covering:
- C++ best practices and advanced techniques
- Virtual machine and compiler design insights
- Machine learning applications in various domains
- Software engineering methodologies and sustainability
- Industry trends and technical deep-dives

*This section will be updated as I publish new content.*

## Professional Focus

While I don't currently have extensive open source contributions due to time constraints, my professional work has focused on:
- **Low-latency C++**: Applications for trading and finance
- **Language Design**: Working with proprietary programming languages and runtimes
- **High-Performance Computing**: Optimizing runtime systems and virtual machines
- **Machine Learning Applications**: Applying ML techniques to real-world problems
- **Sustainability in Software**: Promoting green software engineering practices
